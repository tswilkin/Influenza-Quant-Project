This repository is for my project in the Quantitative Methods Class at the College of Charleston.

This goal for this project is to determine if environmental variables determine different influenza subtypes all across the lower 48 states.  

Another future goal I have for this project is to see if changes in environmental variables will also change the subtype, and also to see if subtypes are replaced by others over time.
